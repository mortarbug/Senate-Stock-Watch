# Senate-Stock-Watch

## I. Research Goals and Objectives
The purpose of this project is to investigate a publicly available dataset of stock transactions made by US Senators. From the investigation, I hope to identify factors that might predict outperformance of a transaction over the short term.

The primary dataset that I will be using was taken from QuiverQuant. As of this writing, it consists of 1898 observations, tracking Senate stock disclosures between January 2020 and June 2021.
